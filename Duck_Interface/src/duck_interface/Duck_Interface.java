purpose:

    Assume you are working on a duck information system (Mallard, Marbled, 
Canvasback, Rubber duckie, robotic duck, â€¦) Use Java interface to create two 
protocols (interfaces: quack and fly) for each class of duck in the information 
system so that users can insert and search for duck information. Test your 
program with at least two types of ducks. Put the source code and 
screenshots of program execution in a folder called 
"yourFirstName  yourLastName Java Interface". Compress the folder into a 
zip file and upload it to Blackboard.
