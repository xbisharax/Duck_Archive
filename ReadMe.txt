This code was made for the purpose of getting familiar with Java Interface. I took it upon myself to try it out with separate files. After getting used to this I found that doing this naturally gets me more organized. I'll be coding in the future with classes and interfaces in separate files whenever appropriate.

The Duck_Interface folder can just be directly put into your NetBeans Projects folder and everything should work fine.

I recommend doing this since I've done this project with multiple files.
