This is a simple project to simulate what an archive of ducks would look like. There is a menu of different types of ducks to choose from. Upon request of a certain type of duck, you'll be given information about it.

This code was made to get familiar with Java Interface. I took it upon myself to try it out with separate files. After getting used to this I found that doing this naturally gets me more organized. I'll be coding in the future with classes and interfaces in separate files whenever appropriate.

Apache Netbeans IDE 11.3 was used to create the code. 
The Duck_Interface folder can be directly put into your NetBeans Projects folder and everything should work fine.
